# disable-middle-mouse

Middle mouse paste is a default setting in Ubuntu. It may be a useful function for normal user, but it is a ugly function
for me when edit a large source file if scrolling by the middle mouse for spurious triggering.

I google for a long time, found it:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Input

following the document,  I could diable middle mouse.
